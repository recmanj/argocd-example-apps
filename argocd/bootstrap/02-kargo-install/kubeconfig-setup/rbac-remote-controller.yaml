# ClusterRoleBinding for Remote Controllers
# This binding grants full admin permissions to the remote controller service account
# by binding it to the existing kargo-admin ClusterRole.
#
# NOTE: This gives the remote controller complete, cluster-wide access to all Kargo resources.
# Consider using more restrictive permissions for production environments.
